# Mogi Helper

Allow you to calculate the points in a current Competitive Mario Kart Match.

Basic set of rules :
- You can select the lenght of teams (1 player, 2 players, ... up to 6 players per team) and so the "type of mogi" (in the MK community we say 2v2mogi instead of 2v2v2v2v2v2)
- You can select the duration of the match (4,8, ... up to 48 tracks, even though the most common is 12 tracks)
- Calculates the points for each team for you, based on the player ranking you gaved it (for each track).
- Display the final placings at the end of the match.

Current plans :
- Doing a simple algorithm using python
- Upgrade it so it can be a web app
- Maybe add other functions later on
